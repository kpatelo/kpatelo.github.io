## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 7, part 1

  This is one of my favorite labs because it takes real-world rules, like parking restrictions, and turns them into a fun programming challenge. It expands my capabilities to systems, allowing me to automate different rules or situations based on set conditions. It allows me to break down real-world rules into precise conditions—can also apply to automating workflows, coding alerts for specific time-based tasks, or building smart assistant features.

* Lab 4, part 2

  This lab is my second favorite because it’s interactive, and fun, and made me think about how to structure a program. Designing a guessing game from scratch helped me practice writing those if statements and figuring out the logic with my partner, which felt rewarding. I loved how simple it was to start, but it still challenged us to debug and problem-solve, which made it a great learning experience. I could also use it for reference for any future guessing games I code.  

* Lab 8, part 1

  This was my favorite lab because I loved how it taught me to work with lists of data, find the minimum and maximum values, and apply mathematical logic to calculate the average while using an approach that reinforced fairness and impartiality. I found this especially fun to work on because I’ve always been into sports and this gave me a better idea of how scores are given.
